# Sherlock Holmes Appreciation

This Sherlock Holmes Appreciation website was used to practice CSS Flex, CSS Grid, Image Responsiveness and proper Web Accessibility practices. Many other things were improved upon, such as my usage of rem/em units, Responsive Typography, Web Accessibility Roles, Aria-label/Aria-labelledby, and much more.
